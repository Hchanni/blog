I'm a Developer Infrastructure Engineer at Abnormal Security, where I specialize in build systems, CI/CD pipelines, and developer tooling.

My work focuses on optimizing development workflows through efficient Bazel configurations, streamlining build processes, and implementing robust continuous integration and deployment solutions.

This blog serves as a space to share insights, experiences, and technical knowledge gained from working with modern development infrastructure.
